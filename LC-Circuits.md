# Learning Inductor & Capacitor(LC)
***
## Capacitors
* **Reactance Formula :**

* Understanding the formula, the impedance (--) when frequency (++)
* The current leads the Voltage in Capacitor circuits

* Charging curve of a Capacitor
* Phasor diagram for Capacitor

  ## Resonance LC circuit
  * When it's on Resonance where Xc = Xl. and Inductor//Capacitor(Parallel)
    * Tank circuit is formed. No It(totalCurrent). Because Sum current to cap and inductor sums to **Zero**

## Design Approach 
 * Low Frequency 
  * Current loop will take the shortest path due to low resistance. 
 * High Frequency
  * Current loop will take the path with lowest impidance. like the coax-shield pair.
  
  * **WHY ????**
   * This is due to the impidance is calculated = R + jÏ‰L. Where when the loop area is bigger the inductance increases as result the higer the frquency the more the impidance.
