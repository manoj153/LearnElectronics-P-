# Learning about Caps in practical circuits.
****

## Two Major use of caps
 1. **Decoupling**
 2. **Bypass**
## Low frequency De Caps
* Place it near Input supply point.
  * Note Low frequency noise don't matter where you place the caps. As long the farads are enough big.  

## High frequency De caps
* Place near to active IC point.
